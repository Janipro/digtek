# Datamaskiner og digitalteknikk
Some assignments I've done for one of my classes. <br>
The code is developed and tested on a [EFM32GiantGecko](https://www.silabs.com/mcu/32-bit/efm32-giant-gecko) 32-bit Microcontroller.

## Structure
**exercises/assembly** for code written in Assembly. <br>
**exercises/c** for code written in C.

Helper files have been included to make the code easier to read and understand. <br>
